**Summary**:  
- a) Screen time has no significant impact on students' sleep quality; Despite substantial variations in screen time across groups, average sleep duration remained stable at around 7 hours with minimal fluctuation. Both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were close to zero and statistically non-significant.  
- b) Sleep quality demonstrates strong stability and is primarily regulated by the complex interplay of multiple factors.

**[Statement of Contribution]**
